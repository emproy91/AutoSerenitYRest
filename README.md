# AutoSerenitYRest
This is the development for a SIIGO challenge, where we will test client creation on the platform using the Screenplay pattern, with Serenity BDD, Cucumber, Gradle, Gherkin, Java, and JMeter; we will also perform REST API tests on the ReqRes page using Serenity-Rest and Postman, also under the Screenplay pattern. Maybe a bonus in POM. ;)
